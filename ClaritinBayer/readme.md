# Claritin of Bayer

This is the old site for Bayer's Claritin drug. I removed the Foundation framework because there were too many security warnings. I chose Tywind.css, I like to learn new things. I livened up the site a bit with effects. From the 221 MB size of the old site, the new one is 7.78 MB.
My efforts were worth it.
