Gracenote is a site made with WordPress. Here is the original site (https://www.gracenote.com/).  
 It is made with paid plugins. In my site I have recreated the original site with an accuracy of about 95%.  
  Having made some improvements, for example, I have changed the font size, text color, etc. Some of the plugins in the original site generate a lot of redundant html, I solved this challenge with html and css.  
  I only used free plugins
