# Maguwo Host is PSD to HTML project

Version 1: 2017 year

Changes from the original vision:

- A small redesign

- removing fonts in a local folder and using online google fonts

- add button "Back to top" with smooth scroll

- add responsive design via bootstrap-grid only

- create a separate file with javascript code

- rename readme.txt to readme.md and add information

Version 2 : 2022 year

- Adding the fonts from the psd found with folder fonts

- Аdding effects to buttons and menus

- Styling the titles and texts as in the psi

- Include the latest version of Bootstrap

- Remove redundant jQuery plugin and replacing with css only

- Аdding social icons and hover effect invented by me

This version of the design is 98% accurate to PSD. I reduced the file size from 13.3 MB to 12.7 MB.
