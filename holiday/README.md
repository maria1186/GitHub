# New Bootstrap5.* template website

I took this template from [here](https://templatemo.com/tm-475-holiday) and updated and edited it. I installed the latest versions of jquery and bootstrap (at the time of creation), fixed a few issues in the responsive design. I removed unnecessary things like: Moment.js, Bootstrap datepicker, moved inline javascript to separate file.
